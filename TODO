+ Using down-arrow to select list of values; handle escape on list
+ Fix project selection on value selector + keyboard shortcut
+ Extract keyboard shortcuts into a buffer to be saved as a separate properties file
+ Load keyboard shortcut property file and merge with existing properties
+ Context Sensitive Menu Service - sensitive to file type
+ Customizable menus: Global (use for phlp actions); Mode (mode specific menus); VCS (Version Control menu)
+ Change the border when the docked panel gets and loses focus
+ Buffer status panel should be tied to edit pane, not view
+ Fix ValueSelector list model so items can be removed and changed in the list dynamically
+ Indication of running processes in buffer status panel
+ "Process" list as popup dialog instead of dockable
+ Improve tail efficiency
+ Differentiate Servers and Tools
+ Reload buffer after JMeld (in case user has saved some changes, since jEdit does not detect this)

* Use toolbar instead of menu for selector dialog actions
* Selector shouldn't populate the view until user has typed something in; more sensible default wildcards; populate view with
  list of recent choices; more status info on selected items
* Support TASKS - named collection of buffers that can be opened and closed as a unit
* Move error list to jeditutil, add suggestions, make all info available within textarea
* Add more info to the process runner buffer panel
* Use user-defined jEdit shortcut keys for navigation/editing in Value Selection (currently hardcoded ctrl+n, ctrl+p)
* ALT-LEFT ALT-RIGHT style history navigation api provided to other plugings (with dropdown in buffer status panel)
* Mode menus sensitive to not only mode but also "sub-mode": for instance, mode "xml" could be "hbm.xml" in which case we want
  additional menu items? (or could we just create an hbm.xml mode and import the "xml" definition?)

- Global menus have some mode sensitivity?
- Implement completion framework or use SideKick?
- Add option for case (in)sensitive search to value dialog

- Where do i use this symbol (method/field/class/table/property)?
- Where is this symbol (method/field/class/table/property) defined?
- Describe this symbol (language specific)
